She holds a Bachelor of Secondary Education degree in Physics from Philippine Normal University and a Master of Education degree in Physics from De La Salle University both under full scholarship. With such immense experience and great customer service, Biba Baking Supplies Shop gained attention in the community. 
									The company has five employees who were carefully selected and underwent seminars via DTI seminars and rigorous training from different master classes provided by the company.
									<br><br>
									Biba Baking Supplies Shop was established in July 2008 in San Andres Bukid, Manila as a homebased husband and wife tandem, formerly known as Biba Cakes and Pastries. The company produced customized and specialty cakes and pastries primarily to families and friends. Through the word of mouth and the availability of online selling via Multiply, the company extended it services to different customers with events and celebrations requiring cakes and pastries in Manila and nearby provinces.
									<br><br>
									In January 2015, the company transferred to its new location in Morong, Rizal. The company opened their first physical store offering customized cakes and pastries to Rizal residents as well as keeping their Manila loyal customers. The retail store also sells baking ingredients and packaging materials to bakeshops and homebased bakers as the company saw the opportunity as home bakers grow in number bakers. The shop was able to connect with direct manufacturers and suppliers for a competitive pricing as compared to the price in Manila. Biba also provides free demo and seminars in partnership with suppliers and DTI Rizal Negosyo Centers particularly Morong and Tanay to homebased bakers as part of Biba’s corporate social responsibility to the community.
									<br><br>
									In the process of participating the KMME program of DTI Rizal, Biba decided to launch for a classic and unique product that the company will be known for. They have been baking Silvana and Sans Rival only as per order by clients who are willing to pay premium. In June 2019, they launched their bite size Silvana Bites and Sans Rival Macarons at an affordable price.
